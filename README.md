# Python Keyword Implementation - Library Management System
Banagan Charles Gabrielle D.
BSIT-2B

## Project Overview

This Python project demonstrates the use of all Python keywords in a meaningful and practical context. The program simulates a Library Management System where users can add, borrow, and return books. The project is designed to cover all the keywords required in Python, while maintaining clear code structure, readability, and logic.

### Program Features

Add a book to the library
Borrow a book from the library
Return a borrowed book
Check if a book is available in the library
Display available books
Handle exceptions (e.g., invalid operations)
Save library data to a file


Keywords Used
This project incorporates the following Python keywords:

and: Used in logical conditions.

as: Used in exception handling.

assert: Ensures that a certain condition holds true (validates book availability).

break: Breaks out of a loop under a specific condition (stopping iteration if a book has more than 10 copies).

class: Defines the Library class that contains the main operations.

continue: Skips the current iteration in a loop (if the book is out of stock).

def: Defines functions (e.g., for borrowing, returning books).

del: Deletes a book from the library.

elif: Part of conditional logic to check multiple conditions (e.g., different actions like 'add', 'borrow', 'return').

else: Used as the default case in conditional logic.

except: Catches and handles exceptions (e.g., invalid quantity for book).

False: Used for boolean logic.

finally: A block that always runs in exception handling.

for: Used for looping through items (e.g., iterating over books in the library).

from: Used to import specific parts of a module (e.g., datetime from the datetime module).

global: Allows modification of a global variable (total_books_added).

if: Used for conditional checks (e.g., checking availability of books).

import: Used to import external libraries (e.g., time, datetime).

in: Used to check membership in data structures (e.g., checking if a book exists in the library).

is: Used to check object identity (e.g., checking if a book is None).

lambda: Used to define a simple anonymous function (e.g., calculating total number of books).

None: Represents the absence of a value (e.g., checking if a book is not found).

nonlocal: Allows modification of a variable in the enclosing scope (e.g., modifying the count variable inside a nested function).

not: Used for logical negation.

or: Logical 'or' used in conditions.

pass: A placeholder for an empty function body.

raise: Used to manually trigger an exception (e.g., raising an exception if the quantity of a book is invalid).

return: Used to return values from functions.

True: Used in boolean logic.

try: Starts a block of code where exceptions are handled.

while: Used to create a loop that continues until a condition is met.

with: Used to handle file operations safely (e.g., saving library data to a file).

yield: Used to create a generator that yields book details one at a time.
