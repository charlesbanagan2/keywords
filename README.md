# Python Keyword Implementation - Library Management System
Banagan Charles Gabrielle D.
BSIT-2B

## Project Overview

This Python project demonstrates the use of all Python keywords in a meaningful and practical context. The program simulates a Library Management System where users can add, borrow, and return books. The project is designed to cover all the keywords required in Python, while maintaining clear code structure, readability, and logic.

### Program Features

Add a book to the library
Borrow a book from the library
Return a borrowed book
Check if a book is available in the library
Display available books
Handle exceptions (e.g., invalid operations)
Save library data to a file


Keywords Used
This project incorporates the following Python keywords:

and: Used in logical conditions.

as: Used in exception handling.

assert: Ensures that a certain condition holds true 

break: Breaks out of a loop under a specific condition 

class: Defines the Library class that contains the main operations.

continue: Skips the current iteration in a loop 

def: Defines functions 

del: Deletes a book from the library.

elif: Part of conditional logic to check multiple conditions 

else: Used as the default case in conditional logic.

except: Catches and handles exceptions.

False: Used for boolean logic.

finally: A block that always runs in exception handling.

for: Used for looping through items 

from: Used to import specific parts of a module 

global: Allows modification of a global variable 

if: Used for conditional checks 

import: Used to import external libraries 

in: Used to check membership in data structures 

is: Used to check object identity 

lambda: Used to define a simple anonymous function 

None: Represents the absence of a value 

nonlocal: Allows modification of a variable in the enclosing scope 

not: Used for logical negation.

or: Logical 'or' used in conditions.

pass: A placeholder for an empty function body.

raise: Used to manually trigger an exception 

return: Used to return values from functions.

True: Used in boolean logic.

try: Starts a block of code where exceptions are handled.

while: Used to create a loop that continues until a condition is met.

with: Used to handle file operations safely 

yield: Used to create a generator that yields book details one at a time.
